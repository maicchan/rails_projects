DEPRECATION WARNING: [Devise] `DeviseHelper#devise_error_messages!` is deprecated and will be
removed in the next major version.

Devise now uses a partial under "devise/shared/error_messages" to display
error messages by default, and make them easier to customize. Update your
views changing calls from:

    <%= devise_error_messages! %>

to:

    <%= render "devise/shared/error_messages", resource: resource %>

To start customizing how errors are displayed, you can copy the partial
from devise to your `app/views` folder. Alternatively, you can run
`rails g devise:views` which will copy all of them again to your app.

DEPRECATION WARNING: [Devise] `DeviseHelper#devise_error_messages!` is deprecated and will be
removed in the next major version.

Devise now uses a partial under "devise/shared/error_messages" to display
error messages by default, and make them easier to customize. Update your
views changing calls from:

    <%= devise_error_messages! %>

to:

    <%= render "devise/shared/error_messages", resource: resource %>

To start customizing how errors are displayed, you can copy the partial
from devise to your `app/views` folder. Alternatively, you can run
`rails g devise:views` which will copy all of them again to your app.
